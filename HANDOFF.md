# HANDOFF.md — v2-zero-fork branch

**Purpose:** any session (human, agent, subagent) reads this first. No context from memory, no inferred state. Current state lives here and in `git log`.

## Rules of engagement

1. **Read this file first. Read `git log --oneline -10` second.** That's the state.
2. **One task per commit.** Small, reviewable, bisectable.
3. **After each task:** update this file. Tick the box. Write the next concrete action.
4. **Before commit:** `pnpm test` must pass. Build only if shipping.
5. **If you get compacted mid-task:** do nothing weird on recovery — read this file, check git, resume from the next unchecked box.

## Branch: `v2-zero-fork`

## Status as of 2026-04-18 17:59 EDT

### ✅ Done and committed

- [x] `0cd5ab7` — Fix #1: separate onboarding from workspace shell (overlay stacking)
- [x] `35f0eb6` — Fix #2: guard root bootstrap from uncaught errors
- [x] `094feda` — Fix #3: zero-fork guards model switch via dashboard info
- [x] `4490598` — Fix #4: synthesize tool pills from inline dashboard stream markers
- [x] `9df67be` — Cleanup: remove duplicate `MODEL_SWITCH_BLOCKED_TOAST` import

All tests pass: **25/25** (`pnpm test`).

### ⏳ Next up — in this order

- [ ] **Browser QA on :3005** — hard-refresh, clear localStorage, verify:
  1. Onboarding tour renders alone (no workspace shell behind it), completes, shell loads
  2. Model switcher → pick alternate → toast `Model switching requires the enhanced fork…` fires, model doesn't change
  3. Send `fetch https://example.com` → tool-call pill renders inline in the message
  4. Capture any console errors; if nothing fails, tick this box

- [ ] **Full prod build** — `pnpm build` — confirm no SSR or typecheck regressions

- [ ] **Delete dead route** — `src/routes/api/model-info.ts` is unused (real route is `src/routes/api/model/info.ts` which the client fetches). Grep confirms no imports, but re-check before deleting. Then regenerate `routeTree.gen.ts`. Separate commit.

- [ ] **README v2 rewrite** — merge draft from `/Users/aurora/.ocplatform/workspace/content/workspace-v2-launch/readme-rewrite.md` into `README.md` at repo root. Commit.

- [ ] **Tag and ship** — `git tag v2.0.0 && git push origin v2-zero-fork --tags` — only when QA + README done.

### 🧊 Cold storage (do not touch unless explicitly asked)

- Memory browser already works via gateway `/api/memory/*`
- Sessions, streaming, config, skills all pass vanilla `pip install hermes-agent`
- Gateway runs zero-fork mode by default

## If you hit a wall

- **Rate-limited on openai-codex:** switch model with `hermes config set model anthropic-oauth/claude-opus-4-7` and restart the agent
- **Vite error in :3005 overlay:** read `/tmp/vite-3005.log`. Most errors are HMR hiccups that go away on file save
- **Tests fail:** do not commit. Report the failing test name and the observed vs expected in this file under a new "⚠️ Blockers" section
